CLR Integration, or SQL CLR, lets you create stored procedures, user-defined types, triggers, table valued functions, and aggregates using a .NET managed language. You can read and write to resources outside of SQL Server and enjoy a tighter integration with XML, web services, and simple file and logging capabilities.   Here's the reference you'll want on your desk as you develop SQL CLR solutions. It helps you decide whether to use SQL CLR, how to lock down security, and learn from real examples. If you want to develop stored procedures or other objects in .NET for SQL Server 2005, this book offers exactly what you need.   What you will learn from this book    The concepts and architecture of SQL CLR  Uses of .NET namespaces in SQL Server programming tasks  How to develop and benchmark routines in T-SQL and .NET to determine when CLR-based solutions are advantageous  How to replace extended stored procedures using SQL CLR stored procedures  How to use SQL CLR objects in external applications  How to restrict and secure SQL CLR object capabilities  Processes and procedures for deploying SQL CLR objects     Who this book is for   This book is for developers and architects who are familiar with .NET concepts as well as DBAs who, although developers in their own right, may be slightly less up to date on .NET. A solid grounding in T-SQL is necessary.   Wrox Professional guides are planned and written by working programmers to meet the real-world needs of programmers, developers, and IT professionals. Focused and relevant, they address the issues technology professionals face every day. They provide examples, practical solutions, and expert education in new technologies, all designed to help programmers do a better job."

SQLite is the next big thing in the PHP Web development world - the popular, easy to use database is supported by, and bundled with, the much-anticipated PHP 5.
With over 15 million PHP Web sites, the release of PHP 5 will create a tremendous influx of new SQLite users.
The book provides a thorough, hands-on guide to using, administering, and programming SQLite. 

SQLite is a small, fast, embeddable database that is being bundled with PHP 5. This means that SQLite will be used -- or at least tried out -- by the millions of developers that use PHP. There is some online documentation of SQLite, but it isn't organized in a useful fashion, it has large gaps, and it leans heavily on coding comments. ""It's small, fast and very low footprint,. . .I'm exceedingly pleased with SQLite. Since converting. . . to use it, performance and space efficiency have vastly improved over previous versions, and the ease-of-use (and ease-of-setup) perspective makes it tremendously more appropriate for embedded use in a tool of this sort than depending on a full-fledged out-of-process database server. In short: Try it. You'll like it."" -- Review on Freshmeat.

It has been applied to different relevant problems in database theory such as query optimization, query containment and equivalence, dependency implication, and database schema design. Recent years have seen a renewed interest in the chase as an important tool in several database applications, such as data exchange and integration, query answering in incomplete data, and many others. It is well known that the chase algorithm might be non-terminating and thus, in order for it to find practical applicability, it is crucial to identify cases where its termination is guaranteed. Another important aspect to consider when dealing with the chase is that it can introduce null values into the database, thereby leading to incomplete data. Thus, in several scenarios where the chase is used the problem of dealing with data dependencies and incomplete data arises. This book discusses fundamental issues concerning data dependencies and incomplete data with a particular focus on the chase and its applications in different database areas. We report recent results about the crucial issue of identifying conditions that guarantee the chase termination. Different database applications where the chase is a central tool are discussed with particular attention devoted to query answering in the presence of data dependencies and database schema design."

Such a target instance should correctly represent information from the source instance under the constraints imposed by the target schema, and it should allow one to evaluate queries on the target instance in a way that is semantically consistent with the source data. Data exchange is an old problem that re-emerged as an active research topic recently, due to the increased need for exchange of data in various formats, often in e-business applications. In this lecture, we give an overview of the basic concepts of data exchange in both relational and XML contexts. We give examples of data exchange problems, and we introduce the main tasks that need to addressed. We then discuss relational data exchange, concentrating on issues such as relational schema mappings, materializing target instances (including canonical solutions and cores), query answering, and query rewriting. After that, we discuss metadata management, i.e., handling schema mappings themselves. We pay particular attention to operations on schema mappings, such as composition and inverse. Finally, we describe both data exchange and metadata management in the context of XML. We use mappings based on transforming tree patterns, and we show that they lead to a host of new problems that did not arise in the relational case, but they need to be addressed for XML.

Unfortunately, the reality is that the improved hardware hasn't kept pace with the ever-increasing quantity of data processed today. Although disk packing densities have increased enormously, making storage costs extremely low and sequential read very fast, random reads are still painfully slow. Many of the old design recommendations are therefore no longer valid-the optimal point of indexing has come a long way. Consequently many of the old problems haven't actually gone away-they have simply changed their appearance.    This book provides an easy but effective approach to the design of indexes and tables. Using lots of examples and case studies, the authors describe how the DB2, Oracle, and SQL Server optimizers determine how to access data, and how CPU and response times for the resulting access paths can be quickly estimated. This enables comparisons to be made of the various designs, and helps you choose available choices for the most appropriate design.    This book is intended for anyone who wants to understand the issues of SQL performance or how to design tables and indexes effectively. With this title, readers with many years of experience of relational systems will be able to better grasp the implications that have been brought into play by the introduction of new hardware.    An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available online from the Wiley editorial department.    An Instructor Support FTP site is also available."

The collaborating authors have solved many of the worst Oracle performance problems in the world, and they've each saved at least one doomed flagship project. Over many years, they've been sharing their unique knowledge with each other at conferences, around the OakTable, and in coffee shops, restaurants, and bars on five continents. Now they want to share their key insights with you. A major focus of this book concerns the ways in which you can avoid common and debilitating mistakes when building Oracle software projects. From these stories, you'll learn the simple steps that will help you avoid real pain on your next (or current) Oracle project."

""Preface Cloud. Database. Middleware. Applications. Exalogic. Exalytics. Java. Servers. Virtualization. Storage. What do these, and the rest of those products listed in Figure P.1, all have in common? Simple. It's Oracle. Oracle is just about everywhere, in every category, as shown in Table P.1, and it has the market share to prove it. According to Gartner, Inc., Oracle is number one in worldwide RDBMS (relational database management system) software revenue share, holds a larger revenue share than the four closest competitors combined, and leads the next closest competitor's revenue share by 29%. So it's a no-brainer that now, or sometime in the near future, most executives will be confronted with having to manage one or more Oracle products. Given the share diversity of the Oracle product line, and the level of complexity of integration, management is quite a daunting prospect. However, all is not rosy in the Kingdom of Oracle. A recent Fortune magazine article asked, ""What you do when you're the best company in your industry, but your industry is mired in a slump of mediocre performance?"" (Kelleher 2013). This is not really a book about Oracle's financial performance. However, it is important, when making a commitment to Oracle products and services, to understand the ramifications tied to what many consider to be a macroeconomic slowdown in the global market. Many argue, however, that it's not so much the global economics that's the problem. These pundits say that the doldrums the industry is facing are caused by the shift to cloud computing. This is probably the reason that Oracle is placing such an emphasis on its cloud products. We will touch on many of these products in several chapters of this book""--"

This book focuses on the idea of formalising knowledge as relations, interpreting knowledge represented in databases or logic programs as relational data and discovering new knowledge by identifying hidden and defining new relations. After a brief introduction to representational issues, the author develops a relational language for abstract machine learning problems. He then uses this language to discuss traditional methods such as clustering and decision tree induction, before moving onto two previously underestimated topics that are just coming to the fore: rough set data analysis and inductive logic programming. Its clear and precise presentation is ideal for undergraduate computer science students. The book will also interest those who study artificial intelligence or machine learning at the graduate level. Exercises are provided and each concept is introduced using the same example domain, making it easier to compare the individual properties of different approaches""--"

Ilyas,,"Ranking queries are widely used in data exploration, data analysis and decision making scenarios. While most of the currently proposed ranking techniques focus on deterministic data, several emerging applications involve data that are imprecise or uncertain. Ranking uncertain data raises new challenges in query semantics and processing, making conventional methods inapplicable. Furthermore, the interplay between ranking and uncertainty models introduces new dimensions for ordering query results that do not exist in the traditional settings. This lecture describes new formulations and processing techniques for ranking queries on uncertain data. The formulations are based on marriage of traditional ranking semantics with possible worlds semantics under widely-adopted uncertainty models. In particular, we focus on discussing the impact of tuple-level and attribute-level uncertainty on the semantics and processing techniques of ranking queries. Under the tuple-level uncertainty model, we describe new processing techniques leveraging the capabilities of relational database systems to recognize and handle data uncertainty in score-based ranking. Under the attribute-level uncertainty model, we describe new probabilistic ranking models and a set of query evaluation algorithms, including sampling-based techniques. We also discuss supporting rank join queries on uncertain data, and we show how to extend current rank join methods to handle uncertainty in scoring attributes."

Combining computers and music has a long and fruitful heritage. Moreover, the ideas which underpin the connection between calculating and composing date back centuries. In the 21st century, computers and music are more closely aligned than ever before. In particular, computers have become indispensable in music making, distribution, performance, and consumption. This book introduces important concepts and skills necessary to make music with computers. It interweaves computing pedagogy with musical concepts and creative activities. It does this while maintaining a natural, steady increase in computational skills that are always motivated by creative musical contexts. This book is mainly intended for introductory computer science courses and for courses in the intersection of computing and the arts. However, it is naturally suited for self-study. It assumes little musical and programming experience; it introduces topics and concepts as they arise through motivating, and hopefully inspiring examples. This book addresses two trends in computing education: (1) the growing use of the Python language for teaching introductory programming, and (2) the increasing infusion of computational thinking into liberal arts courses, especially interdisciplinary offerings in computing and the arts. It does so by presenting computer music topics in an accessible manner for our two main target audiences:""--"

Based on the author’s experience working for an agricultural biotechnology company, Python for Bioinformatics helps scientists solve their biological problems by helping them understand the basics of programming. Requiring no prior knowledge of programming-related concepts, the book focuses on the easy-to-use, yet powerful, Python computer language.

The book begins with a very basic introduction that teaches the principles of programming. It then introduces the Biopython package, which can be useful in solving life science problems. The next section covers sophisticated tools for bioinformatics, including relational database management systems and XML. The last part illustrates applications with source code, such as sequence manipulation, filtering vector contamination, calculating DNA melting temperature, parsing a genbank file, inferring splicing sites, and more. The appendices provide a wealth of supplementary information, including instructions for installing Python and Biopython and a Python language and style guide.

By incorporating examples in biology as well as code fragments throughout, the author places a special emphasis on practice, encouraging readers to experiment with the code.
